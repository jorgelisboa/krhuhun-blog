<p>
Krhuhun's Blog is my personal project that will be a real project working in production to show for companies what I'm able to make with a litlle bit of my experience and time. The project was idealized by me and my girlfriend, after participating on "Imersão React" from Alura, where we learned React and used Supabase to put an Application online. The idea of a blog became from a feeling to show a little bit from our world (the technology world) to other people, sharing information and knowledge, counting with development tips, tech News and everything that we would like to show.

Also, the project will be a little bit of:

<ul>
  <li>Explanation of 
    <a href="https://pt-br.reactjs.org">React</a>, 
    <a href="https://nextjs.org">Next.js</a>, 
    <a href="https://firebase.google.com/">Firebase</a>, 
    and <a href="https://developer.android.com/?hl=pt-br">Android</a> development.
  </li>
  <li>Learning project for us and everyone who would like to.</li>
  <li>Challenge for us, creating again a full application from zero.</li>
</ul>
